<h2> The Species </h2>

<p> Rhinoceros Sondaicus, their given scientific name, belong to the Rhinocerotidae family, being the rarest member out of the 5. It has a horn that usually reaches 10 inches, 
and loose skin folds. The weights can range from about 2,000 to 5,000 pounds! Their height is from 5 to 5.5 feet tall and length, 6 to 11.5 feet wide. They typically habituate in tropical forests, and eat 
tree leaves, branches, and bark. </p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img class="happyrhino" src="download.jpg" alt="Happy Javan Rhino"> <img class="happyrhino" src="download-1.jpg" alt="Javan Rhino in water">

<h2>Critically Endangered</h2>
<p> The shocking truth about these animals is the possibility of long-term survival is decreasing. There are currently 60-63 Javan Rhinos living in total, all located in Indonesia. Ujung Kulon National Park
keeps the remaining animals in a tightly secure habitat. With such a small area to live in, they are at risk of inbreeding, causing problems in the species. The sanctuary also has a large Arenga palm tree that 
causes a decline in vegetation. Because of where the Javan Rhinos prefer to live, along the coastline, they are at a high risk with tsunamis and another natural disatsers. They are 
also faced with such a threat of extinction because of hunting for their horns. The last remaining Javan Rhino in Vietnam was killed and 
removed of it's horn from a poacher.

<h3> &nbsp; What Can We Do? </h3> <!--I used nonbreaking space for an indent-->
<p>World Wild Life Foundation has created a plan to save the population for the Javan species. Keeping all the animals in one habitat geographically can cause a decrease in reproduction, so they decided to spread the
habitats to two locations. This new sanctuary is located in a place outside of potential natural disasters, and will benefit breeding. We all can help this plan move to action by donating. A simple donation can go a long way in a big project
such as this. Click below to help rescue the Javan Rhinoceros!
