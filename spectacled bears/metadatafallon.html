	<h2> Where Does Their Name Come From?</h2>
	<p>Spectacled Bears are given their name because of the rings of yellow or gold circling around their eyes, like spectacles. Another name you may refer to these bears as is an Andean Bear, because of their habitation in the Andes Mountain!</p>
	<br/>
	
	<h2> Where Do They Live?</h2>
	<p>These bears enjoy mostly rain forests, grasslands, and scrublands(lands consisting of a scrub vegetation.) They prefer mountainous areas due to the range of altitudes. You can find them climbing trees and forming large nests/platforms on branches to eat and rest there.

	<h2> Save These Bears!</h2>
	<p>Sadly, these adorable bears' conservation is uncertain. The rate of population for them decreases 2-4 percent a year. Thankfully, organizations are being arranged, and are working with zoos and conservatories to 
	preserve the Spectacled Bears existence.<a href="http://sbc-peru.org/pages/en/home.php" target="_blank"> Donate here!</a> <p>
	<p>World Wild Life organization created a fun way to benefit these bears!
